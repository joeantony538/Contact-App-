# Contact-App-
I'm Joe Antony Puthussery,i've selected the second question which is a contact app as my work. I've been able to make this app till the sign in and sign up activity, which fetches the data from the sign up activity, and stores it in a database. This app should work on api > 29. I've been testing this app on a Pixel 4 API 30 emulator, and it works fine with no crash till the storing phase.
